During the pandemic, I watched a documentary about a whale that can't communicate with others due to a hearing deformity. Though one would assume this whale would feel sadness because of its isolation, one could also argue that its ignorance of companionship makes its life much easier.";

var DTRT01 = "I created this film at home during spring break. The documentary style shows that I'm trying to teach something to the audience. My message didn't get across well, but I tried my best. From a technical standpoint, this was my first time using proper microphone setups, though much of the audio needed to improve. There are many references to sealife within the shots to reference the theme of loneliness and to compare the main character to the 52 Hertz Whale.";

var DTRT03 = "I wasn't nearly as bummed out during the pandemic as everybody else. Years later - after making good friends in college - I realized I didn't miss any of my companions during the pandemic because I didn't have any close companions to miss! Now that I understand the hype behind close friendships, I know why the pandemic was isolating for so many people, but at the same time, I can attest to the peace of mind that can come from being a friendless hermit such as the 52 Hertz Whale. The character in 52 Blues demonstrates that strangely, it's possible to overcome - or at least fight against -  loneliness by focusing on the health of oneself.";
